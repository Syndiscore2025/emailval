You are taking over a production email validation application that is nearly ready for deployment.

IMMEDIATE MISSION:
Complete webhook functionality testing to verify the system is production-ready.

CONTEXT:
- This is a PRODUCTION application with REAL data (6,243 emails in database)
- Repository: https://github.com/Syndiscore2025/emailval.git
- Working directory: c:\Users\micha\emailval\emailval
- Server runs on: http://localhost:5000
- Beta tests: 8/8 passing ✅
- Webhook tests: Created but need verification ⏳

WHAT WAS JUST COMPLETED:
✅ SMTP performance optimization (50 workers, configurable)
✅ Bulk operations (Delete All Disposable, Re-verify All Invalid)
✅ Data persistence fixes
✅ API key creation fix
✅ Comprehensive beta test suite (all passing)
✅ CRM webhook payload fixes
✅ Code cleanup (removed 20+ obsolete test files)

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Run webhook_test.py successfully and verify all 5 scenarios work:
   - CRM Webhook (HubSpot format)
   - CRM Webhook (Salesforce format)
   - One-time validation mode
   - Rate limiting enforcement
   - Webhook signature verification

2. Test CRM integration end-to-end:
   - Verify crm_record_id and crm_metadata returned correctly
   - Test async callback functionality
   - Test integration modes (crm vs standalone)

3. Test API authentication:
   - API key authentication (X-API-Key header)
   - Rate limiting (100 req/min)
   - Invalid/missing API key handling
   - Revoked API key handling

4. Document webhook testing results:
   - Create summary report
   - Document any issues found
   - Provide request/response examples

CRITICAL RULES:
❌ NEVER hardcode fake/mock/demo data - we have real production data
❌ NEVER modify core validation logic unless fixing a bug
❌ NEVER delete working code
✅ ALWAYS commit and push after making changes
✅ ALWAYS test before committing
✅ ALWAYS build new features in modules

FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md - What was just accomplished and what's next
2. NEW_AGENT_BRIEFING.md - Complete mission brief with all context
3. webhook_test.py - The test suite you need to run

DEBUGGING TIPS:
- Webhook test output not showing? Try: python webhook_test.py 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath results.txt
- Check server logs for webhook requests
- Use Postman or curl to test endpoints manually
- Check data/api_keys.json for created API keys

GIT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix/Feature: Clear description"
git push origin main

NEXT PHASE:
Once webhook testing is complete → Phase 5 (Render Deployment)

START BY:
1. Reading HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md
2. Reading NEW_AGENT_BRIEFING.md
3. Starting the server: python app.py
4. Running the beta tests: python quick_beta_test.py
5. Running the webhook tests: python webhook_test.py
6. Documenting results

Good luck! Complete the webhook testing and get ready for deployment! 🚀
